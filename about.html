<blockquote>

  As a banking Analyst going through my second layoff in 4 years, and I have decided to try to figure out what my true passion is.  I have love of finance, particularly personal finance. I started career in Detroit three years prior the "Great Recession". I have passion for talking to people, and talking finance. As I have had many conversations with small business owners, one the most common issues is technology.
